JasperFXport 
==========



## Description

JasperFXport is a pure JavaFX UI for previewing, printing, and exporting Jasper reports.

It allows you to apply a CSS to match the style of your UI.

You can supply a separate stage to contain the preview, or you can supply a pane to contain the preview in your existing stage.

Here is a sample screen showing the controls at the top. The slider control allows you to page through the report. 

You can print the report, or export it to PDF, Excel, or HTML.
